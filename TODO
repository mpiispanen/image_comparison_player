TODO:
- Make worker thread add images to the cache directly instead of sending to main thread
- Loop video playback
    - Works I think?
- Stop loading images if we have moved so far past the image that it is not needed anymore
- Create textures ahead of time
- Improve cache visualization and make it hideable
- Fix race condition in player

Questions:
- Do we need to lock the player when we are updating the texture cache?

AI suggestions:
Optimize texture caching:
Implement a more efficient caching strategy that predicts which textures will be needed soon and preloads them in the background.
Consider using a least recently used (LRU) cache to manage texture memory more effectively.
Asynchronous rendering:
Consider implementing a double-buffering or triple-buffering system to allow the main thread to continue processing while waiting for the GPU to finish rendering.
