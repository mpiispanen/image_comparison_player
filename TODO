TODO:
- Add flip stats to UI
- Stop loading images if we have moved so far past the image that it is not needed anymore (works?)
- Create textures ahead of time

Questions:
- Do we need to lock the player when we are updating the texture cache?

AI suggestions:
Optimize texture caching:
Implement a more efficient caching strategy that predicts which textures will be needed soon and preloads them in the background.
Consider using a least recently used (LRU) cache to manage texture memory more effectively.
Asynchronous rendering:
Consider implementing a double-buffering or triple-buffering system to allow the main thread to continue processing while waiting for the GPU to finish rendering.
