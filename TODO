TODO:
- Make worker thread add images to the cache directly instead of sending to main thread
- Multithreaded loading
- Loop video playback
- Fix playback
- Stop loading images if we have moved so far past the image that it is not needed anymore
- Multithreaded loading
- Prioritize loading the current frame and frames around it in the direction of playback
- Create textures ahead of time
- Add debug visualisation for cache

Questions:
- Do we need to lock the player when we are updating the texture cache?

AI suggestions:
Optimize texture caching:
Implement a more efficient caching strategy that predicts which textures will be needed soon and preloads them in the background.
Consider using a least recently used (LRU) cache to manage texture memory more effectively.
Asynchronous rendering:
Consider implementing a double-buffering or triple-buffering system to allow the main thread to continue processing while waiting for the GPU to finish rendering.
